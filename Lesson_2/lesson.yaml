    Welcome to Lesson 2 of LiDAR for Forest Ecology! In this lesson, you
    will learn how identify and segment individual trees from an airborne LiDAR
    point cloud to extract tree heights and landscape metrics. You will also 
    have an opportunity to explore the process and challenges of validating
    remote sensing datasets with field collected data.

    For these exercises, we use a dataset from the Abby Road National Ecological 
    Observatory Network (NEON) site in Washington State. As a NEON site, Abby Road 
    is regularly surveyed by airborne remote sensing missions, including LiDAR. 
    In addition, permanent vegetation inventory plots have been established at 
    the site, where ground-based measurements are routinely collected.

    Our area of interest will be the area surrounding one of the vegetation inventory
    plots within the Abby Road NEON site. To start, let's load the point cloud. Please
    type the following into your terminal: 
    
    las = readLAS("ABBY_013_pc_2021.las")
    
  CorrectAnswer: las = readLAS("ABBY_013_pc_2021.las")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='las = readLAS("ABBY_013_pc_2021.las")')
  Hint: |
   Simply type las = readLAS("ABBY_013_pc_2021.las") into your terminal.

  Output: |
    Our point cloud is now loaded into our R environment as an object called las. 
    Let's take a look at it by typing the following into your terminal(this will
    open a new window): 
    
    plot(las, color = "Classification")
    
  CorrectAnswer: plot(las, color = "Classification")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot(las, color = "Classification")')
  Hint: |
    Just copy and paste the following into the terminal: 
    
    plot(las, color = "Classification")
